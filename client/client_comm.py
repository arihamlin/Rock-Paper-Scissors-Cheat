    Different type of requests the clients can handle:
    INIT - Game request from the challenger, defender recieves
           if accepts, sends commitment and initializes encounter
           with the server - they also have to define the
           encounter begins at
    D_COMMIT - Defender player has acknowledge request and returned
               their commitment, challenger have also have to 
               check with the server state that defender posted
               game before continuing and responding with their 
               commitment 
    C_COMMIT - Defender recieves challengers commitment, they
               respond with revealing their turn
    D_REVEAL - Challenger recieves the defenders reveal, and verify
               the commitment they respond with revealing their own turn. 
    C_REVEAL - Defender recieves challengers reveal, and verify the 
               commitment. There are two possiblities at this point:
               1) if have not had three enounters yet they send
               another commitment to the challenger. 
               2) if they have had three they then send a resolve
                to the challanger and post a record of the moves
                to the voters
    RESOLVE - Sent by the defender after three encounters to
              the challenger. Challenger then checks to see
              if the defender has posted the correct things
              to the voters.
